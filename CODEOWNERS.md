A `CODEOWNERS` file has been added to this repository (at the repo root and in `.github/`).

It requests **@vincoodev** as a reviewer for all changes:

- `* @vincoodev`

If you'd like enforcement, enable branch protection rules or MR approval rules in your Git provider.

Note: A GitHub Action was added (`.github/workflows/request-reviewer.yml`) to automatically request **@vincoodev** as a reviewer on every Pull Request.
